# Contribution guidelines and style

Contribution is usually limited to the main robotics programmers (listed in the README), who are allowed to make any edits within reason. 
Programmers, please make any large changes on a new branch, as per the guide to robotics, so that it is easier to check for problems.

The style of coding will be regular camelCase GNAT style code (aka the way everyone learned java). Please do comment stuff too! It will make it much easier for new members to understand.

If you're not from our team, we probably won't let you edit. Go write your own code!
